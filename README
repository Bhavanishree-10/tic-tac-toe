🎮 Neon Tactics (Tic-Tac-Toe)
  Welcome to Neon Tactics! This isn't your average boring Tic-Tac-Toe game. I wanted to build something that feels modern, looks cool, and actually offers a challenge.
  I built this project to practice front-end web development, specifically focusing on game logic and artificial intelligence.

✨ Features
  Futuristic UI: A dark, neon-themed interface with glowing effects and animations.
  3 Difficulty Levels:
  Basic: The AI plays randomly. Good for a confidence boost!
  Intermediate: The AI tries to win and will block you if you're about to win, but it makes mistakes.
  Hard (Unbeatable): I implemented the Minimax Algorithm here. The AI calculates every possible move. The best you can hope for is a draw. 😎
  Scoreboard: Keeps track of your wins, losses, and ties during the session.
  Responsive: Works great on desktop and looks just as good on your phone.

🕹️ How to Play
  Select your difficulty level from the dropdown menu (it defaults to Hard because I like a challenge).
  You are X (Cyan) and the Computer is O (Pink).
  Click any empty box to make your move.
  Try to get 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
  If the game ends, a popup will appear telling you who won. Click "Play Again" to keep the scores and go to the next round.
  Hit "Reset Score" if you want to wipe the scoreboard clean.

🛠️ Tech Stack
  HTML5: For the structure of the grid and layout.
  CSS3: Uses Flexbox and Grid for layout, plus CSS Variables for the neon colors and keyframes for the glowing animations.
  JavaScript (Vanilla): No frameworks used. Just pure logic to handle the game state, UI updates, and the AI.

🧠 The AI Logic
  For the Hard mode, I used a recursive function called Minimax. Basically, when it's the AI's turn, it simulates playing the game out to the very end for every empty spot.
  If a move leads to the AI winning, it gives it a score of +10.
  If it leads to the AI losing, it gets -10.
  If it's a tie, it gets 0. It then picks the move with the highest score. This makes it impossible to beat mathematically.
